# TiraLeet

TiraLeet is a personal repository containing my **LeetCode solutions implemented exclusively in Java**.  
The goal of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms** while writing **clean, readable, and efficient Java code**.

Each solution is organized by problem category to make revision easy and to help identify common algorithmic patterns.  
This repository also serves as a reference for **interview preparation** and consistent problem-solving practice using Java.
